"Implement both desktop and mobile UIs as a cohesive, modern Real Estate Flip Tracker:

– **Desktop (Tauri + Web):**  
  • React 18 + TypeScript, Vite  
  • Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for styling and accessible components  
  • Zustand for local state + React Query for server caching  
  • Tauri IPC integration for SQLite-backed data store  
  • Recharts or D3 for budget and expense charts, Framer Motion for smooth panel transitions  
  • Code-splitting, lazy loading, virtualization for performance  
  • Mobile-first breakpoints, responsive layouts with Flexbox/Grid

– **Mobile (Expo + React Native):**  
  • React Native + Expo for iOS/Android single codebase  
  • Offline-first SQLite storage + background sync to FastAPI via REST  
  • React Navigation, Redux Toolkit or React Hook Form for form flows  
  • Camera, OCR, GPS & audio integration for expense capture, photo docs, and voice notes  
  • Gesture support & skeleton loaders for interactive responsiveness  
  • Conflict resolution UI feedback and loading/toast notifications  

Ensure a shared design system and reusable components, full accessibility (ARIA, semantic elements, keyboard/touch nav), real‐time feedback (optimistic updates, spinners), and top performance across platforms."
