# BudgetFlip Development Conversation Summary

## Date: 2025-07-31

### What We Built
1. **Complete BudgetFlip Application**
   - Monday.com-style UI with multiple views (Grid, Kanban, Table, Calendar)
   - PWA mobile app with offline support
   - Full backend with PostgreSQL and Redis
   - Docker development environment
   - Authentication system with JWT

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
2. **Backend**: Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Redis
3. **Development**: Docker Compose for easy setup
4. **Deployment**: Free tier strategy (Supabase + Vercel)

### Important Commands
```bash
# Start development
docker-compose up -d

# Access application
http://localhost:5173

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```
