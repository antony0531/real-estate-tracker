## 📝 Technical Notes

### Service Worker Strategy:
```javascript
// Cache-first for static assets
// Network-first for API calls (future)
// Offline fallback for all routes
```

### Storage Architecture:
```
localStorage: Settings & preferences
IndexedDB: Projects, expenses, photos (planned)
Cache API: Static assets & offline pages
```

### Security Measures:
- HTTPS required for PWA
- Local-only data storage
- No external dependencies
- Content Security Policy
